# Time-Series-Data-Smoother
Suppress noise and extract the meaningful trends for time series data

This module is useful for pre-processing time series data for forecasting purposes. Noisy data requires more observations in order to tease out relationships and fit a model to the true underlying phenomena. Furthermore, noisy data artificially reduces testing and validation scores when assessing model performance.
